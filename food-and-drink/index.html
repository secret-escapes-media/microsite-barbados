      <p>Let’s cut to the chase; rum. Barbados is rum’s spiritual home. No trip to this island is complete without sampling the finest rum in the world. A distillery tour is a good start, with St Nicholas Abbey already mentioned in the culture section as a more picturesque option compared to the famous Mount Gay tour. But for that true, authentic touch, seek out the rum bars.</p>
      <p>Rum bars are small roadside shacks that, and you’ll be glad to hear this, sell rum! These quaint little hangouts are an intrinsic part of Bajan culture; be it for a quick tipple, or to mull the day over with friends and strangers, it’s an experience you shouldn’t miss. Lucky, then, that there’s around 1,500 to choose from. You won’t miss them either; colourful artwork depicts the sponsor of an individual rum shop. </p>

      <p>Bajan’s sure do know how to cook up a feast. With island treats including cou cou, flying fish, macaroni pie and cutters, there’s plenty of Bajan goodness to whet your appetite. Already mentioned are the famous rum shacks; a great spot to get some cheap, authentic cou cou and flying fish to help soak up the rum – for a cheap bite these places are great. For a truly special street food experience there’s no place like Oistin’s Fish Fry on a friday night. It becomes the evening hangout for all the island, with plenty traders serving up the freshest catches plus a host of barbecued meats and sumptuous sides. Throw in music, rum punches and one electric atmosphere, and you have the ingredients for an unforgettable night out – Bajan style.</p>
      <p>For haute cuisine, look no further than The Cliff, Daphne’s, Cin Cin or the slightly more funky Scarlet. The majority offer stunning beach side tables, and incredible culinary delights. </p>
