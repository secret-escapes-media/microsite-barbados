    description: Experience firsthand the beautiful dichotomy of this island by venturing eastwards to the Scotland District. So named by early Scottish settlers who found the rugged hillsides, shrouded in sea spray and fringed with thunderous, foaming Atlantic tide, reminiscent of the western coastline of Scotland, the area is a national park and stands in breathtaking contrast to the island's glittering west Coast. Stunning shorelines, gullies alive with flora and fauna (spot the island's famous green monkey), and quaint countryside villages where you can have friendly chats with the locals and sample delicious, fresh fruit directly from their backyards; this is Barbados' charming heartland.

    title: Barbados Wildlife Reserve
    description: Just across the road from Farley Hill National Park is the Barbados Wildlife Reserve, a walk-through zoo that is an excellent spot to get up close and personal with Bajan wildlife. It’s an immersive experience, where animals are free to roam the grounds, scurrying] across your path and disappearing into the mahogany wood. Barbados Green Monkeys are a common site here, particularly around feeding time, though they are free to leave the reserve as and when they please. A walk-through aviary is a particularly stunning site, with parrots, flamingos and peacocks busying the scene. You’ll catch brocket deer, armadillos, caimans, plenty of reptiles – animal lovers alight!

    title: Harrison's Cave
    description: An eerie subterranean landscape encroached by a chorus of stalactites and stalagmites make for a curious adventure deep into the underbelly of Barbados. Embark on a journey delving into the earth on an electric tram, which will take you further and further into the depths of the island. You’ll alight at underground rivers, which cascade further downward in magnificent waterfalls. Harrison’s Cave is a truly immersive experience, and a great way to cool off on a hot day...
