intro: Immerse yourself in the Year of Culinary Experiences. With over one hundred exquisite restaurants on island, it is no surprise that Barbados is regarded as the culinary capital of the Caribbean. Regardless of how you decide to tantalise your taste buds on the island, be sure to complement the meal with a refreshing cocktail prepared by one of our talented mixologists, infused with the indigenous spirit of the island, rum!

    description: Let’s cut to the chase; rum. Barbados is rum’s spiritual home. For an authentic touch, seek out the rum bars. Rum bars are small roadside shacks that, and you’ll be glad to hear this, sell rum! These quaint little hangouts are an intrinsic part of Bajan culture; be it for a quick tipple, or to mull the day over with friends and strangers, it’s an experience you shouldn’t miss. Lucky, then, that there’s around 1,500 to choose from. You won’t miss them either; colourful artwork depicts the sponsor of an individual rum shop. Most will also sell food and snacks, and generally these charming little watering holes are the cheapest place on the island. Tours are available, and most taxi drivers will gladly take you on their very own rum shop tour!

    description: Bajan’s sure do know how to cook up a feast. With island treats including cou cou, flying fish, macaroni pie and cutters, there’s plenty of Bajan goodness to whet your appetite. Already mentioned are the famous rum shacks; a great spot to get some cheap, authentic cou cou and flying fish to help soak up the rum – for a cheap bite these places are great. For a truly special street food experience there’s no place like Oistin’s Fish Fry on a friday night. It becomes the evening hangout for all the island, with plenty traders serving up the freshest catches plus a host of barbecued meats and sumptuous sides. Throw in music, rum punches and one electric atmosphere, and you have the ingredients for an unforgettable night out – Bajan style.

    description: For the finer things, like the island’s best cocktails, make a trip to some of the higher-end hotels – The Cliff, Cin Cin or the chic Scarlet being great examples. For haute cuisine, the same names spring to mind. The majority offer stunning beach side tables, and incredible culinary delights. Superb cocktails, fine Bajan dining and the chance to watch the sun dip into the sea – a sublime evening of opulence and luxury.
