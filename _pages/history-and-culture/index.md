  title: Calypso Calypso
  content: You won’t ever be far from the infectious rhythms and unique voicing of the Caribbean scene; from mento, calypso and soca, to dancehall and reggaeton, watch the locals hip-shake and twist into the night. Calypso, originating from Trinidad & Tobago, took the Caribbean by storm. Still to this day, it’s inescapable; but the vivacious Bajans took it one step further. Jackie Opel, born in Barbados and one of the pioneers of ska and rocksteady in Jamaica, fused calypso, ska and R&B to create spouge – a thorough-bred Bajan music style. It’s a bit of a rarity nowadays, but this frenetic and vivacious style encapsulates the spirit of the island perfectly.

  title: St Nicholas Abbey
  content: This sugar plantation courses with history; from the stark dichotomy between echoes of Caribbean slavery against the opulence of the Great House, it tells an intriguing story of Bajan history. The house itself is an incredibly well restored example of a Jacobean mansion, on one of the oldest plantations in the Caribbean. The plantation itself produced sugar cane, and aside from export, a distillery soon followed producing rum. Barbados is lauded as the birthplace of rum, and St Nicholas Abbey is a far more picturesque place to try a rum tour than the more commercial spots on the island. After touring the intricate and immaculate interiors of the Grand House, and checking in at the distillery, the grounds themselves boast some beautiful gardens – one not to miss would be Cherry Tree Hill, the historic mahogany lined avenue which boasts, as the locals will tell you, the best views on the island.

  title: St Michael’s cathedral
  content: St Michael’s is a fascinating visual metaphor of colonization and imperialism; it’s a very traditional looking Anglican chapel – traditional if you were in an English village, perhaps in Kent. But you’re not, it’s about 30-odd degrees outside and you’re in beautiful Barbados. So it’s fair to say that St Michael’s architecture seems rather out of place, but in being so, it tells the story of British Imperialism in one simple frame. So for a rather odd, stark reminder of Bajan colonial history, stroll through the parish and take a peek.
