  title: Catching waves at the Soup Bowl
  content: This low-key surfing spot is held in high regard by some of the world’s pro surfers. The Soup Bowl, so called for its foamy surf, is a beautiful stretch of beach with iconic rock formations and plenty of stooped palm trees offering respite from the sun. Facing the Atlantic, the water here is rougher than on the more idyllic, western side. This makes for great surfing, and plenty travel to this spot to ride the famous Soup Bowl. A must for any budding surfers.

  title: Swim with turtles
  content: Take a boat across the water to hidden coves and take a dip with magnificent turtles. These majestic, wizened creatures are a sight to behold, and found in greater numbers thanks to ongoing conservation work by the state. A key factor when embarking on a tour like this is to check that the operators work ethically; Barbados Blue are a great example of an operator that does ongoing conservation work whilst running limited tours. Swimming with turtles is an unmissable experience.
